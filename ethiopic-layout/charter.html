<h1 id="title">Ethiopic Text Layout Task Force Charter</h1>
<p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of this task force  is to  document requirements for the layout and presentation of text in the major languages of China when those languages are used by Web standards such as HTML,  CSS, Mobile Web and Unicode. </p>
<p class="mission">The documents will provide requirements for the development of W3C standards affected by  languages used in China and will therefore address scripts that include not only Hanzi, but also  scripts used by minority linguistic groups in China<del>)</del>. In particular, the task force will include work on Mongolian, Tibetan and Uighur scripts. These scripts are also used by communities outside of China, and participation in this work by those communities is welcomed. This task force will gather and integrate feedback from the participating members about the need  for and technical feasibility of various requirements.</p>
<p class="mission">The Task Force is part of the Internationalization Interest Group.</p>

<p class="mission">The aim of this task force is to follow the example of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">Requirements for Japanese Text Layout</a> and collect information about specific use cases  for technologies defined in various Web specifications as they relate to the aforementioned scripts, and to report the results of its activities as a group back to the Internationalization  Working Group, as well as to other relevant groups and to the W3C membership and community.</p>

<div class="scope">
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>The proposal for the group originated from consultation with stakeholders and W3C members in China on how to help facilitate increased involvement in W3C activities around CSS, digital-publishing, and other Web technologies for the languages of China.</p>
<p>In addition to those specifications, the group may review (but is by no means explicitly limited to reviewing) the following: 
  
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The work of the Internationalization Working Group.</li>
  <li>CSS3 Modules, in particular:
    <ul>
      <li>CSS3 Text</li>
      <li>CSS3 Lists</li>
      <li>CSS3 Counter Styles</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>Browser testing and Tools</li>
<li>HTML (in particular references to Ruby, locale-specific formats, and other internationalization aspects)</li>
</ul>

<p>The group may also review draft specifications produced by Web API related working groups. Along with reviewing the above mentioned specifications and related specifications, it is expected that the group will also gather comments and questions about those specifications, collect information about specific use cases in China for technologies defined in those specifications, and report the results of its activities as a group back to the Internationalization Working Group, as well as to other relevant groups - such as the HTML Working Group, CSS Working Group, SVG Working Group, etc.</p>

<h3>Initial set of languages</h3>

<p>Statistically, 1.7 billion of the world population use Ethiopic (including both simplified Ethiopic and traditional Ethiopic) as the main language, 8 million speak Tibetan, 6 million speak Mongolian, and 12 million speak Uighur. And some of the minority groups in China share the same languages and/or scripts with people who live in other countries, e.g. Mongolian and Korean. Though these shared languages and scripts are homogenous, the font, pronunciation and layout requirements might be different. </p>
<p>Scripts included within the initial scope of the project  are Simplified &amp; Traditional Ethiopic, Mongolian, Tibetan and Arabic as used for Uighur. </p>
<p>At a later date the scope may be extended to cover additional scripts used by minority groups in China. Here is an incomplete list of the languages used in China and other related regions: Hanzi (Ethiopic characters, Traditional, Simplified), Tibetan, Uygur, Mongolian, Korean, Dai, Kazakh, Kirgiz, Yi, etc. Additional languages will be included based on the availability of linguistic and typographic experts. </p>
<div>
  <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<p>The Ethiopic Text Layout Task Force will not produce Recommendation-track deliverables but will produce documents that can be published by the Internationalization Working Group as Working Group Notes on  text layout and related technologies in China and elsewhere, the contents of which might include (but by no means are explicitly limited to) the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements for  Text Layout and presentation.</li>
<li>Requirements for Digital Publications.</li>
<li>Translation of W3C drafts of related technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The group may also choose to produce other non-normative deliverables, such as test cases and error reports â€“ under the terms of the Policies for Contribution of Test Cases to W3C, and in coordination with any relevant working groups. 
</p>

<p>Target deliverables are documents which include but are not limited to (Simplified &amp; Traditional) Ethiopic Layout Requirements,  Tibetan Layout Requirements, Mongolian Layout Requirements, and Uyghur Layout Requirements.</p>


<h3>Milestones</h3>

<p>Plans for the main document deliverable are as follows. All deliverables will be made available in both English and Ethiopic.</p>

<p>W3C/Beihang host has already done some extensive work on CSS requirements for Ethiopic languages (especially Traditional Ethiopic/Hanzi, and Simplified Ethiopic/Hanzi). A developing working draft report is available on the W3C China Web Site. In September 2014, W3C/Beihang host organized a <a href="http://www.chinaw3c.org/layout-workshop.html">Ethiopic Layout Requirements Workshop</a>. Participants showed great interest in language text layout requirements for Hanzi, and other major scripts used in China. The <a href="http://www.chinaw3c.org/layout-workshop-report.html">final report</a> of the workshop is available on the W3C China Web Site.  </p>
<p>Other deliverables will be produced on an ongoing basis throughout the life of the charter, and the specific topics to be addressed by the task force and schedule information cannot be determined far in advance, but are driven by the needs of the Web community.</div>

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

<p>The success of the Task Force will be evaluated based on how productively it engages with W3C members and the relevant script communities  to promote discussion of specifications that affect layout and presentation of  languages  on the Web, and how effectively it is able to produce additional documents for the refinement, implementation, and adoption of  text layout and related technologies in China and worldwide.</p>
</div>

<div class="dependencies">
<h2 id="coordination">Relationships to External Groups</h2>

<p>Working Drafts and Notes will be published by the i18n WG, and the i18n WG will work with the task force closely to assist with development and review of the documents.</p>

</div>

<div class="participation">
<h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>

<p>To be successful, the Ethiopic Text Layout Task Force is expected to have 15 active participants for its duration. Effective participation to Ethiopic Text Layout Task Force is expected to consume one work day per week for each participant; two days per week for editors.</p>

<p>Participants are reminded of the <a
href="/2005/10/Process-20051014/groups.html#good-standing">Good
Standing requirements</a> of the W3C Process.</p>
</div>

<div class="communication">
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<p>Ethiopic Text Layout Task Force discussions take place in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other areas using scripts covered by the project. However, any Notes or other reports eventually contributed by a group back to the W3C will be made available in both English and Ethiopic.</p>
<p>Many of the contributors to the work of the task force will want to communicate in Ethiopic. The publicly archived public-zhreq@w3.org list  (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-zhreq/">archive</a>) was set up as a Ethiopic-language list for this purpose. </p>

<p>The task force also reaches out to the wider international community with discussions and announcements in English on the following lists: public-i18n-cjk@w3.org  (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-cjk/">archive</a>) for Simplified and Traditional Ethiopic, public-i18n-mongolian@w3.org (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-mongolian/">archive</a>) for Mongolian, and public-i18n-tibetan@w3.org (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-tibetan/">archive</a>) for Tibetan. Other lists can be made available as needed. Those English-speaking lists will, in particular, be used for gathering and replying to feedback on the documents. </p>
<p>The  lists must archive or point to minutes and summaries of all teleconferences and face-to-face meetings. Meeting minutes will list all attendees at a given meeting.</p>

<p>  These include meeting agenda, which should be published before each teleconference or face-to-face meeting.</p>

<p>The group will use the <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/"> Internationalization Activity home page </a> and <a
href="http://www.chinaw3c.org/"> W3C China Website </a>to provide updated public information about its activities.
</p>

<p> Information about the group (deliverables, participants, face-to-face meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is available from the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/International/core/">Internationalization  Working Group</a> home page and from the home page of the Task Force.</p>

</div>

<div class="decisions">
<h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

<p>As explained in the Process Document (<a
href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section 3.3</a>),
this group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. In cases where there is a need to formally produce a group resolution about a particular issue, its Chair will put a question about the issue to the group and gather responses (including any formal objections); then, after due consideration of all the responses, the Chair will record a group resolution (possibly after a formal vote and also along with responding to any formal objections).</p>
